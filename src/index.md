# Rémi Parrot
I am assistant professor within [Nantes Université](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/) - [École Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/).
I belong to the [STR](https://www.ls2n.fr/equipe/str/ "Systèmes Temps Réel") research team at [LS2N](https://www.ls2n.fr/).

# Research
I am mainly interested in *model checking* systems with time, weights and concurrency.
In other words, I play with *automaton*, *Petri nets* and their extensions with time and weights.

Recently, I have been (or am currently) working on:

- identification of Petri nets
- expressivity of Petri nets with time
- model checking and control on weighted timed automaton

# Students
- *Manon Le Moigne* is a PhD student (supervised by [Olivier Roux](https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~roux-o/en_index.html) and myself).
She is working on the identification of Petri nets (for the moment) with time (maybe in the future).
- *Mathieu Doucen* is a master student (supervised by [Didier Lime](https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~lime-d/) and myself).
He is working on parameters synthesis on weighted timed automaton.
